Sure, here's an example of a GitHub repo description for a Node.js project with MongoDB database and the required APIs using the Express.js framework:

# Node.js Project with MongoDB Database and APIs using Express.js

This is a simple web application built with Node.js and MongoDB, using the Express.js framework and other popular libraries and tools. The application provides a set of APIs for user authentication, card management, and board management.

## Features

- User authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Password reset with email instructions
- Card management: add a new card to a list
- Board management: list all the lists and cards of a board
- MongoDB database with Mongoose ORM

## Technologies

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- bcrypt
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Nodemailer
- dotenv

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/nodejs-mongodb-express.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set the environment variables in a `.env` file (see `.env.example` for an example)
4. Start the application: `npm start`

## Usage

1. Register a new user with the `/signup` API
2. Authenticate the user with the `/login` API to obtain a JWT
3. Use the JWT to access the protected APIs (`/add-card` and `/list-board`)
4. Send a POST request to `/forgot-password` to reset a forgotten password
5. Use the token sent to the email to reset the password with the `/reset-password/:token` API
